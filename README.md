# Bun TypeScript Template

This project emphasizes modern, strict clean code practices and idiomatic patterns in TypeScript.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run the application:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

## Best Practices

- Follow TypeScript's strict mode for type safety.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Write unit tests for critical components.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.3.5. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
